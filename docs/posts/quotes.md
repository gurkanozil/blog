# Quotes

A collection of quotes that resonate with me, categorized for clarity.

## Productivity & Problem Solving

### Gall's Law

> "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.
> A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work.
> You have to start over with a working simple system."

> John Gall _[Gall's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall%27s_law)_

In essence, Gall's Law highlights that complex systems should evolve from simple, functional ones through iterative development.

My key takeaway is to always start with a working prototype and incrementally build upon it, embracing adaptability and minimizing the risk of large-scale failures.

**Lesson:** Start with an MVP in software. Break down large personal goals into smaller steps.

### Solve the Problem First

> "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code." - John Johnson

This quote taught me the importance of planning and problem-solving before diving into coding. A clear understanding of the problem leads to a more efficient and effective solution.

**Lesson:** Understand the problem before coding. Clearly define problems in all areas of life before attempting solutions.

### Write Code for Humans

> "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." - Martin Fowler

This highlights the importance of writing clean, readable code. Code should be easily understood and maintained by other developers (or your future self!).

**Lesson:** Write readable code with clear names and comments. Communicate clearly in all situations.

### Simplicity is Key

> "Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability." - Edsger W. Dijkstra

Complex code is often harder to debug and more prone to errors. Striving for simplicity improves the reliability and maintainability of software.

**Lesson:** Aim for elegant, simple solutions in code. Simplify routines and declutter to reduce stress.

### Avoid Premature Optimization

> "Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming." - Donald Knuth

Focus on writing functional and readable code first. Optimize only when necessary and when performance bottlenecks are identified.

**Lesson:** Focus on functionality first, optimizing only when necessary. Avoid wasting time on unnecessary complexities.

### Story: Sharpening the Saw

> Imagine a scene in the woods:
> a person laboring intensely,
> sawing at a tree with visible strain.
>
> You approach and inquire, "What are you doing?"
>
> The response, filled with impatience, is,
> "Can't you see? I'm sawing down this tree!"
>
> Noticing their exhaustion, you exclaim,
> "You look beat! How long have you been at it?"
>
> "Over five hours," they reply,
> "and I'm exhausted! This is hard work."
>
> You suggest, "Why not pause for a few minutes
> and sharpen the saw? It would surely be faster."
>
> But the person retorts emphatically,
> "I don't have time to sharpen the saw;
> I'm too busy sawing!"

> Stephen Covey, _[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People®](https://www.franklincovey.com/courses/the-7-habits/habit-7/)_

This anecdote emphasizes the importance of self-care,
continuous improvement,
and taking time to invest in oneself to increase overall effectiveness.

It also taught me to regularly take a step back
and reevaluate whether I'm approaching tasks in the most efficient way possible.

Sometimes, the best way to move forward is to pause, reassess,
and sharpen the saw.

**Lesson:** Take breaks to learn and avoid burnout. Prioritize continuous learning.

### On Continuous Improvement

> "The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried."

> Stephen McCranie

This quote reminds me that failure is a necessary part of the learning process and that persistence is key to mastery.

**Lesson:** Embrace failure as a learning opportunity. Persistence is key to growth.

Passion for your work fuels creativity and dedication, leading to higher quality results.

**Lesson:** Work on projects you're passionate about for higher quality and job satisfaction.

### Be of Value

> "Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value." - Albert Einstein

Focus on creating solutions that benefit others. Success often follows when you prioritize providing value.

**Lesson:** Create software that solves real problems. This is more fulfilling than chasing success alone.

### Tie Happiness to Goals

> "If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things." - Albert Einstein

Having clear goals provides direction and purpose, contributing to a more fulfilling career.

**Lesson:** Set clear, achievable goals for direction and accomplishment.

### Don't Fear Failure

> "Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game." - Babe Ruth

Don't be afraid to take risks and try new things. Failure is a learning opportunity and a necessary part of growth.

This quote from Rumi highlights the importance of inner peace and self-sufficiency.

This inspires a lifelong pursuit of knowledge and personal growth. **Never stop learning** and expanding your horizons.
