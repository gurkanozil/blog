# My Journey into Technology and Self-Discovery

### Early Exposure to Technology

When I was a young kid, about 10 years old, I was first exposed to the internet when my brother allowed me to use his PC while he went out. Naturally, I was curious. "What is this?" I asked.

"This is the internet!" He said. "I can play RuneScape, World of Warcraft, watch YouTube videos, and message my friends." He showed me his in-game character, a funny cat video, and a chat window buzzing with messages.

That simple question sparked something in me. Soon after, I began exploring the internet on my own. I discovered YouTube, watching countless videos on various topics. I also found streamers playing video games, most notably Minecraft. I even went through a phase of installing cracked versions before finally purchasing the game. It was through Minecraft that I discovered the world of **Minecraft mods**, fascinated by how a few lines of code in **Java** could transform a game. My curiosity only grew as I explored the rest of the world wide web. The more I explored, the more I realized that the only real limit to what could be created was imagination itself.

### First Experiences with HTML and CSS

My first experiences with HTML were mostly from tutorials, where I learned what was possible using only **HTML, CSS, and JS**. I felt amazing creating something visible and showing it off to everyone I knew. That sense of accomplishment still drives me to this day, especially as I work on personal projects or modify systems to suit my needs.

### The Love for Customization

Over time, I became deeply involved in **customization**. I enjoy personalizing everything I touch, from my operating system (I use Arch Linux btw) to my software tools, to my phone. This interest taught me to troubleshoot and fix bugs, as making changes often broke the system or software. I would research the causes of these issues, make the necessary changes, and test until I was satisfied with the result. This problem-solving process has become a cornerstone of my career and personal growth. You can read more about my customization journey [here](./customization-journey).

## Neurodivergence and Hyperfocus

### Embracing Neurodivergence

One of the most important elements of my personality is my neurodivergence, something I’ve come to appreciate as a gift rather than a limitation. It means that when I find something that excites me, I can dive into it with a level of **hyperfocus** that lets me immerse myself in details others might miss. Whether it’s working on cars, fitness, reading about anatomy, studying psychology, or diving into philosophy, I get a sense of joy from going deep into topics and understanding them on a level that truly resonates with me. You can read more about how I use hyperfocus [here](./neurodivergence-hyperfocus).

### Becoming the Expert in My Circle

This hyperfocus has often led me to become the most knowledgeable person in my circle of friends. Everyone always comes to me with their (often obscure) questions, and I tend to answer them in great detail, helping people around me. For example, I’ve developed the ability to identify car models simply by looking at the headlights or taillights, and I can recognize engines by their sound. In fitness, my research into human anatomy allows me to act as a physical therapist for my family and friends, often providing them with accurate help when they face problems with their bodies.

### Lifelong Learning

I sometimes spend weeks, if not months, researching topics I find intriguing. My hobbies are broad, and once I feel I’ve learned enough about one, I switch to the next. This leads me to new discoveries, expanding my knowledge even further. It’s a never-ending cycle of learning that brings me great joy and satisfaction.

## Balancing My Interests

### Compartmentalizing My Day

I often balance my hobbies and interests using **compartmentalization** and prioritizing tasks throughout the day. I dedicate specific time for my physical health, diet, and exercise, while also making space to learn, read, and apply new knowledge. For example, after discovering a new exercise, I would research it and apply it to my daily fitness routine. This allows me to integrate both physical and intellectual pursuits into my life seamlessly. You can read more about balancing interests [here](./balancing-interests).

## Career Aspirations and Flexibility

### Embracing Flexibility

While I don’t have specific goals due to the broad nature of my interests, this flexibility allows me to excel in everything I do. I am always eager to learn new skills and approach tasks with a mindset of continuous improvement. The drive to excel keeps me flexible, allowing me to adapt to new challenges and grow in whatever direction the world takes me.

However, this also has its downsides like the difficulty in finding a technology or language to specialise in, you can read more about this in my [SWOT analysis](./swot-analysis).

## Technology's Role in My Life

### Optimizing My Life with Technology

Technology has shaped my life in profound ways. It has instilled a desire in me to improve and optimize everything I do. This has led me to write software that automates tasks on my PC and implement **Apple Shortcuts** on my iPhone to perform certain tasks at set times or events. These automations have made my life more efficient and allowed me to focus on multiple things at once, freeing up mental space for more important pursuits.
