# Note-Taking System - Commonplace Notes

This system combines methods to efficiently capture/organize research ideas. Primarily for personal use, I'll experiment with various note-taking methods, potentially incorporating systems listed at the end. Each notebook serves a specific purpose: capture ideas on the go, organize for research, visualize connections. This system can also be used in conjunction with other note-taking methodologies, such as the [VOMIT System](./VOMIT), to enhance overall effectiveness.

## 1. Pocket Notebook (Idea Capture)

For **quick idea capture**—random thoughts. Focus: **speed & simplicity**.

### Format:

- **Topic/Idea**: Phrase/concept.
- **Tag**: #science, #history (optional).
- **Note**: Brief thought (optional).

### Example:

**March 1, 2025**

- "How does gravity work on a quantum level?" #science
- "Benefits of intermittent fasting" #health
- "How do black holes affect time?" #astrophysics

## 2. Desk Notebook (Research Journal)

For **in-depth topic exploration**. Each page focuses on a specific subject.

### Format:

- **Topic**: Phrase to explore.
- **Description**: Interest in topic.
- **Queue**: Next steps.
- **Priority**: Stars, arrows.

### Example:

**"Quantum Entanglement"**

- Interest: Instantaneous particle communication?
- Queue: Scientific articles.
- Priority: ⭐️⭐️

## 3. Work Notebook (Research Queue)

Track work topics/ideas. Organize by priority/action items.

### Format:

- **Topic/Idea**: Work phrases/topics.
- **Priority & Action**: Urgency/steps.

### Example:

1. "Improve team collaboration using AI"
   - Priority: ⭐️⭐️⭐️
   - Action: AI case studies.
2. "Effective remote team communication"
   - Priority: ⭐️⭐️
   - Action: Internal resources?

## 4. Desk/Home Notebook (Conceptual Map)

**Visualize connections** via mind maps. See how ideas interconnect.

### Format:

- **Central Topic**: Main concept.
- **Branches**: Related ideas.
- **Questions/Keywords**: Guide research.

### Example:

**Central Idea: Healthy Living**

- **Nutrition**:

  - Branches: "Vitamins," "Healthy Eating," "Supplements"
  - Questions: "Vitamin impact?"

- **Exercise**:

  - Branches: "Cardio," "Strength Training," "Yoga"
  - Questions: "Strength training & metabolism?"

- **Mental Health**:
  - Branches: "Meditation," "Mindfulness," "Stress Management"
  - Questions: "Meditation benefits for stress?"

## System Organization:

### 1. **Pocket Notebook**:

On-the-go ideas. Simple: phrases, tags, notes.

### 2. **Desk Notebook**:

Organize topics, track progress, document thoughts. Explore deeply.

### 3. **Work Notebook**:

Work ideas/research, prioritize, track actions.

### 4. **Conceptual Map**:

Brainstorm, visualize connections to spark research.

## Consistency Tips:

- **Review Regularly**: Update notebooks weekly.
- **Contextual Notebooks**: Each notebook serves a purpose.
- **Create an Index**: Locate topics quickly.

## Field Note Documentation:

Considerations:

- **Location/Time**: Specifics, weather.
- **Sensory Details**: Objective descriptions.
- **Descriptive Specificity**: Show, don't tell.
- **People**: Actions, quotes, quirks.
- **Feelings**: Subjective impressions.
- **Audio**: Ambient noise, interviews (permission).

## Why Take Field Notes?

Enhance creative process:

- **Comprehensive Data**: Notes, audio, photos.
- **Raw Material**: Unpolished ideas.
- **Memory Aid**: Accuracy.
- **Productivity Hack**: Record experience.
- **Staying Present**: Observation.
