My interest in software development began early. A childhood
fascination with computers, sparked by a simple interaction with
my brother evolved into a lifelong passion. <a href="./posts/my-story">Read more about it here</a>

This passion led me to pursue a career in software
development, where I've gained experience in full-stack web
development, building numerous projects and I've become proficient
in both front-end and back-end technologies.

I am committed to continuous learning and professional
development within this ever-evolving field, constantly seeking
opportunities to enhance my skillset and broaden my knowledge
base.

I build scalable web applications prioritizing design,
maintainability, and user experience. I craft responsive frontends
and robust backends, employing a holistic approach to my work.
